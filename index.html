                <p class="box-content">Jaguar's business was founded as the Swallow Sidecar Company in 1922, 
                    originally making motorcycle sidecars before developing bodies for passenger cars. 
                    Under the ownership of S. S. Cars Limited, the business extended to complete cars made in association with Standard Motor Co, many bearing Jaguar as a model name. The company's name was changed from S. S. Cars to Jaguar Cars in 1945. A merger with the British Motor Corporation followed in 1966,[3] the resulting enlarged company now being renamed as British Motor Holdings (BMH), 
                    which in 1968 merged with Leyland Motor Corporation and became British Leyland, itself to be nationalised in 1975.</p>
